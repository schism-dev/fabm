|:---------------------------|
| This repository is currently being split, such that only the institutional parts (hereon and vims) will survive and the FABM infrastructure is synchronized with the official FABM repo |

This refactoring will reduce maintenance load.  The three resulting splits will be
1. A copy of the FABM framework regularly synchronized with upstream FABM official, to be uses only for pull requests moving upstream on the FABM infrastructure
2. The VIMS FABM institute repository https://github.com/schism-dev/fabm-vims containing the development of the CoSINE and ICM models, led Zhengui Wang
3. A copy of the Hereon FABM institute repository  https://github.com/schism-dev/fabm-vims containing the development of the augmented gotm-light, MAECS, TAME and OmexDia models.
